# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between **Sleep Duration** and **Sleep Disorder** using statistical and machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains health and lifestyle variables such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Occupation
- Sleep Duration
- Stress Level
- BMI
- Heart Rate
- Physical Activity
- Sleep Disorder (target variable)

## 🎯 Objective
To identify whether short sleep duration causes or predicts the likelihood of a sleep disorder, and to uncover other important contributing factors.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **R** for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization
- **Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression (Exploratory)
  - Multiple Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest

## 📊 Key Findings
- **High Stress Level** and **Short Sleep Duration** are the most important predictors.
- **Random Forest** outperformed other models with ~90% accuracy.
- **Older individuals** and those with **higher heart rates** are also more likely to suffer sleep disorders.

## 📈 Visualizations
- Histograms and bar charts of distributions
- Boxplots comparing sleep duration across disorder types
- Feature importance from Random Forest.

## ✅ Conclusion
Promoting **consistent sleep duration** and managing **stress levels** are key strategies in reducing the risk of sleep disorders.
